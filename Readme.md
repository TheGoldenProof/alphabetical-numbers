### Background

Of all positive whole numbers, which one comes first alphabetically?  
It seems like an impossible question to answer, there's an infinite number of positive whole numbers after all. 
Maybe an easier question is "which one comes last"? The answer is "Zero" of course, because no other number starts with a 'z'.  
That said, there are some rules to how a number must be named:  

1. Do not use 'and'. It's not "one hundred and twelve", it's "one hundred twelve". 
2. Names of large numbers use the "standard" set by Conway and Guy. See [this wikipedia section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers#Extensions_of_the_standard_dictionary_numbers). 
3. "Alphabetical order" here refers to lexicographic order used by computers to compare ascii strings. That is, a shorter word comes before a ' ' (space) character, which comes before 'a'. Not case sensitive however.  

From that we can see that the first number of all positive integers alphabetically is "eight". 
There are no numbers that start with a-d, and the alphabetically first number starting with 'e' is "eight". 
There are lots of other numbers that start with "eight", but as outlined previously, the shortest comes first.
After eight, there is no standard "-illion" prefix that starts with 'a', but there's one that starts with 'b': "billion".
Therefore, the second positive integer alphabetically is "eight billion". 
After that would follow every number starting with "eight billion" - theres one billion of them to be precise.

The last one of those is "eight billion two thousand two hundred two".  
What comes next?  
Well, the next possibility will have to start with the prefix "duo". 
prefixes like that can be chained. In order for it to have the lowest value alphabetically, it must be followed by the alpabetically lowest next possibility. 
Unfortunately, that is "duo" again. So the next number would be something like:  
"Eight duoduoduoduoduoduoduoduoduoduo..."  
And so on for countable infinity. Thus, we are at the end of the beginning of knowable alphabetized numbers.
